# CircleFourier
Fourier Series visual inspired by [coding train](https://github.com/CodingTrain) in [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKyU92cza0Y).

The [Fourier Series Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series) if you want more information about them.

My program uses a class with recursion to display a visual of a Fourier Series similar to the visuals found on the wiki page.
